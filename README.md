I am a front-end programmer working for U & SLUNO a.s., a company based in Ostrava.With more than five years of experience, I specialize in creating modern web applications using frameworks such as React and Next.js. I have experience in front-end and back-end development and I like to learn new technologies and practices.

In previous projects I have had the opportunity to work on a variety of projects, from simple websites to complex applications for large companies. I strive to design and implement quality and optimized code to make the site fast and reliable.

Outside of working on projects, I also enjoy creating my own projects and experimenting with new technologies. I believe that working in this field is an endless adventure and look forward to what the future holds.
